        <h2>His Quotes that can motivate you!</h2>
        <p> 
            I want to be successful, I want to show the culture of Kazakhstan in front of the world. And what I can do is sing.
Everything good and bad is just one moment in life. For me spiritual features of the person are more important than his professional achievements. We came to this life to be human, not singers or teachers, but to be human first of all. We should cherish spiritual values and human qualities. I am grateful to my listeners for their admiration, but sometimes they tend to idealize me. I am an ordinary guy like everybody else. It is the fans who make "stars" out of the artists. My fans are so devoted and give me so much support! They are like family to me.
Of course, everyone likes to hear kind words - you are fine.. you are handsome, you are very talented. But a singer belongs to a group that needs to be strict and firm on their own (on themselves by their own choice). Hearing these words, the singer should be excited and encouraged to work even harder, to further music creation to the next level.
Honestly, I do not like the entertainment circle. To the audience, the artist should be someone who can be an example. They like our song, so they will imitate. So, I think artists need to take the opportunity to try to do something that is educational.
It is important to retain who you are always. We cannot lose our character, wherever you may be. Whether you are a singer artist, a teacher or doctor. One should become a respected person, not proud or complacent.
Any status, any competition cannot give the singer success. The success of the singer is his audience.
In my own inner world, my feelings for the fans, my love and passion for them - I can only use songs to convey. I do not know how to express some of the thoughts in my heart. So sometimes I feel depressed. But I just want to say one thing...No one can take away my love for you. Wherever there are you, there is Dimash on the stage.

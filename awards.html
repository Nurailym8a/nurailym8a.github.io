Here's what this code does:

The <header> section contains the main title of the website.
The <main> section has two <section> elements:
The first section has a heading and a brief description.
The second section has a heading and two <img> elements that display images. You'll need to replace "image1.jpg" and "image2.jpg" with the actual file names of your images.
The <footer> section contains a copyright notice.

You can customize this code further by adding more sections, styling the website with CSS, and including additional functionality with JavaScript. This is just a basic starting point to help you get started with creating your website.

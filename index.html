        <h2>HAPPY TRIP INTO THE MAGICAL WORLD OF DIMASH KUDAIBERGEN. HE WAS BORN TO SING!</h2>
        <p>Dimash begins by saying: If they opened my heart they would see music , if they opened my mind they would encounter only music again- Dimash's grandmother : He collected audio cassettes, put them in a box and always took them with him everywhere, even when he slept and cried if we tried to take it away from him. VOICE: His favorite toys were cassette tapes and he didn't play with anything else. She cried a lot when she learned that his parents wanted to send him to kindergarten and asked to bring his musical instruments with him. Music has always been his latent passion and over the years this has become evident. DIMASH : She (grandmother) had noticed my passion for music. At the age of five, she walked me to music school every day even though she had severe pain in her legs. Dimash's grandmother: Her teacher, Dina, showed him some notes that he would have to repeat, the scary thing was that he managed to recognize and repeat them all. She then told me that he had a unique ear for music. VOICE: Since his childhood, Dimash had a great ability to recognize sounds and melodies. This became evident when he complained that the piano was “out of tune” and he was just five years old. DIMASH: When I was five or six I spent half the day in the music room, while the other children went to school. Young Dimash plays at a Party - VOICE: This is the school class where Dimash learned to read and write. It is the gymnasium n°32 of Aktobe where he studied. His teachers describe him as lonely compared to other children at an early age. . Klara kazhygaliyeva (teacher): Dimash could sing almost all the poems of the great Abay QUnanbaiuly (the greatest Kazakh poet and philosopher). I remember that he was always creating poems, singing and painting, he was very diligent when he studied at school and showed interest (curiosity) during lessons. Roza Kuanysheva (prof.Dimash): I remember once he was tired during my lesson and I asked him if he was okay. He replied that he had spent the whole night trying to slightly modify a traditional Kazakh song that he was going to sing at an event at school and that he had given it as a gift to the school (an event of about a week). The song he sang left everyone amazed at his talent being so young. Svetlana Mamma Dimash: He always wanted to sing for a large audience. We liked the way he analyzed the Kazakh stage songs he listened to. VOICE: It seems like he recognized and nurtured the musician within him from the beginning.

             As if he had only been nourished by music since he was born, if this had not been the case, he would not have been able to say that he was more than ready to participate in the "Zhas Kanat" competition when he was only 15 years old and by regulation he was too young to participate , but he tried anyway.
“Ya lublu til' ki tebya” Ukrainian song.

Svetlana: It was his biggest success until then. She took and raised this golden wing, feeling herself in the clouds.

VOICE: He also participated in the “Eslav Bazar” competition where he impressed everyone by winning first place.

Maira Dauletbakova: this victory was very beautiful but it wasn't easy because it was outdoors, the weather turned bad, the temperature dropped and we caught a very bad cold but Dimash's virtues, determination and persistence, helped us a lot. Even though he was sick he resisted and did what he came for using 100% of his abilities. I cried about it and they were certainly tears of happiness. 

Voice: He was an experienced musician when he entered art school under the name Akhmet Zhubanov, and he revealed his experience as a Dombra and piano musician but he didn't look like a student who was 15 years old. 

Maira Dauletbakova (Honored Artist of the Kazakh Republic): They say that 1% is talent and the other 99% is the result of hard work, and he is someone who works hard, I have never heard that – ok I have this already done and I know it – because for him it's never enough.

VOICE: Dimash's wonderful voice seems to be linked to something invisible and pure. In most cases this was enhanced through his aspiration to sing together with the symphony orchestra.

Arystanbek Mukhamediuly (secretary of culture and sports of the Kazakh republic)
Dimash not only sings the music, he feels it and turns everything into a complete show.  

Yeskendir khasangaliyev (famous Kazakh singer and composer): This type of voice is unique and a rare case in nature, there are few who can sing with 4 and a half octaves. This is a rare gift.

Voice: The melody (timbre) that Dimash produces in music is called CONTRALTO, a voice like this is extremely rare. Few can sing like him and almost everyone is in "Opera", but Dimash has chosen a style unique to him, exclusive, and this differentiates him from the others.

Ayman Musakhadzhayeva (National Artist of the Kazakh Republic Rector of the National University of Art of Kazakhstan): With a range of 4 and a half octaves Dimash surprises all people. In the world, you can count on the fingers of one hand those who have these abilities.
First we tried to convince him that his style did not enhance his talent and that he would be noticed more by doing Opera, we suggested that he work with the “Astana Opera” so that he could have a great career, and he in all confidence told me he said he would continue to do exactly what he was doing and experiment with the range of his voice. 

Abzal Mukhitdinov (Honored Artist of Kazakhstan): Figuratively speaking, Dimash is an explosion in the world of music, he puts a lot of energy while singing. My opinion is that we are entering a new musical era
